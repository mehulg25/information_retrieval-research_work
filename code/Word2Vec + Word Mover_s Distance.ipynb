      "Two Kinds of Power An Essay on Bibliographic Control Wilson, P. The relationships between the organization and control of writings and the organization and control of knowledge and information will inevitably enter our story, for writings contain, along with much else, a great deal of mankind's stock of knowledge and information.  Bibliographical control is a form of power, and if knowledge itself is a form of power, as the familiar slogan claims, bibliographical control is in a certain sense power over power, power to obtain the knowledge recorded in written form.  As writings are not simply, and not in any simple way, storehouses of knowledge, we cannot satisfactorily discuss bibliographical control as simply control over the knowledge and information contained in writings. \n"

The method requires human searchers to base their searching strategies on actual passages from the book rather than on test queries, natural or contrived.  It circumvents the need for relevance judgement, but still yields performance indicators that correspond approximately to the recall and precision ratios of large document retrieval system evaluation.

The test collection consisted of 1712 papers whose relevance to specific queries had been judged by users.  To evaluate the effect of using cocitation data, we calculated for each query two measures of similarity between each relevant paper and every other paper retrieved. Papers were then sorted by the similarity measures, producing two ordered lists.  We then compared the resulting predictions of relevance, partial relevance, and non-relevance to the user's evaluations of the same papers.

The program uses pattern recognition techniques supplemented by heuristics.  During the \"training\" phase, words from pre-classified documents are selected, and the probability of occurrence of each word in each section of CA is computed and stored in a reference dictionary.  The \"classification\" phase matches each word of a document title against the dictionary and assigns a section number to the document using weights derived from the probabilities in the dictionary.  Heuristic techniques are used to normalize word variants such as plurals, past tenses, and gerunds in both the training phase and the classification phase.  The dictionary lookup technique is supplemented by the analysis of chemical nomenclature terms into their component word roots to influence the section to which the documents are assigned.  Program performance and human consistency have been evaluated by comparing the program results against the published sections of CA and by conducting an experiment with people experienced in the assignment of documents to CA sections.

This communication shows that the approach will effect reductions in the number of interdocument comparisons only if the documents are each indexed by a limited number of indexing terms; if exhaustive indexing is used, many document pairs will be compared several times over and the computation will be greater than when conventional approaches are used to generate the similarity matrix.', '69': 'The Use of a minicomputer in various phases of creating the thesaurus for the National Information Center for Special Education Materials (NICSEM) database is described.

They focus on understanding and improving the decision process; a DSS is then designed using any available and suitable technology. Some researchers view DSS as a subfield of MIS, while others regard it as an extension of Management Science techniques.  The former define Decision Support as providing managers with access to data and the latter as giving them access to analytic models.  The key argument of this paper is that the term DSS is relevant to situations where a \"final\" system can be developed only through an adaptive process of learning and evolution.  The design strategy must then focus on getting finished; this is very different from Management Science and Data Processing approaches.  The research issued for DSS center around adaption and evolution; they include managerial learning representation of tasks and user behavior, design architecture and strategies for getting started.', '71': 'A new method is described to extract significant phrases in the title and the abstreact of scientific or technical documents.

Therefrom, various items are extracted and recorded in a hierarchical tree-like inverted file.

This new contribution is supported by the design, implementation, and experimentation of DONAU:  a general purpose domain oriented natural language understanding system developed and presently running at the Milan Polytechnic Artificial Intelligence Project.  The system is based on a two level modular architecture intended to overcome the lack of flexibility and generality often pointed out in many existing systems, and to facilitate the exchange of results and actual experiences between different projects. The horizontal level allows an independent and parallel development of the single segments of the system (syntactic analyser, information extractor, legality controller).  The vertical level ensures the possibility of changing (enlarging or redefining) the definition of the semantic domain on which each particular version of the system is oriented and specialized in a simple, incremental, and user-oriented way.  In the paper the general architecture of the system and the mode of operation of each segment are illustrated in detail.

The scientists served by these systems are often members of what have been called invisible colleges, groups of scientists in frequent communication with one another and involved with highly specialized subject matters.  Often such groups are considered to share an intellectual perspective regarding this subject matter, which is sometimes referred to as a paradigm.  The purpose of this paper is to show how it is possible to identify paradigms, using the techniques of citation analysis.  I will operationalize the notion of paradigm as a 'consensual structure of concepts in a field.' Suppose we have obtained a set of papers pertaining to some topic.  Already knowing something about the field, we read each text and mark passages in which certain specific concepts are used or discussed.  For example, we might find that a concept designated 'A' appears in some sub-set of the papers.  Suppose further that we identify those papers in which concepts 'A' and 'B' are used together in the same papers in a certain specified manner. Clearly not all concepts will combine in a natural way, and not all authors combining concepts 'A' and 'B' will do so in the same way, though some predominant mode may emerge.  For a set of n concepts their structure is given by the totality of admissible combinations of concepts taken from two to n at a time.  The frequency with which a given combination occurs in the sample of papers on the topic is a measure of the degree of consensus regarding the particular concept combination within the corpus.  For concepts taken two at a time, the structure can be displayed as a graph with concepts as nodes and the relations between them represented as lines (arcs) connecting the nodes.  This definition of concept structure is similar to the semantic network of artificial intelligence except that in our approach a measure of consensus weights each arc of the graph.\", '91': 'One mode of online retrieval in Scisearch or Social Scisearch involves entering pairs of authors\\' names believed to be jointly cited by subsequent writers and retrieving papers in which cocitations occur.  Six pairs were formed with the names of four authors prominent in the social indicators movement (Bauer, Duncan, Land, and Sheldon).  Documents by the four were not specified.  It was thought that the pair Duncan and Land would retrieve papers in which indicator-type data would be integrated with path-analytic causal modeling.  All other pairs seemed likely to retrieve a \"general social indicators\" literature.  The 298 retrieved papers confirmed expectattions.  It was found that 121 papers generally cited social indicators (SI) documents by the input authors and frequently had SI language in their titles.  Other signs of content also identified them as papers of the SI movement.  The 177 papers retrieved on Duncan and Land generally cited causal modeling documents by the input pair and were path-analytic in nature.  As expected, they were relatively \"harder\" than the first group of papers, although the two groups are akin and are formally linked through citations in certain papers.

The process produces searchonyms, which are terms synonymous to keywords in the context of a single query.  Augumenting or replacing keywords by searchonyms via manual or automatic feedback leads to the formulation of the next iteration search.  The results of the experiment are consistent with those of an earlier small-scale experiment on an English database, and indicate that in contrast to global clustering where the size of matrices limits applications to small databases and improvements are doubtful, local metrical methods appear to be well suited to arbitrarily large databases, improving precision and recall simultaneously.

Probabilistic weighting is then introduced as an alternative approach and the two systems compared.

They have also suggested criteria which such systems ought to satisfy and record evaluation mechanisms which partially satisfy these criteria.  We offer a more careful analysis, based on a generalization of the discrete weights.  We also look at the weights from an entirely different approach involving thresholds, and we generate an improved evaluation mechanism which seems to fulfill a larger subset of the desired criteria than previous mechanisms.  This new mechanism allows the user to attach a \"threshold\" to the query term.', '98': 'Online retrieval systems may be difficult to use, especially by end users, because of heterogeneity and complexity.  Investigations have concerned the concept of a translating computer interface as a means to simplify access to, and operation of, heterogeneous bibliographic retrieval systems and databases.  The interface allows users to make requests in a common language. These requests are translated by the interface into the appropriate commands for whatever system is being interrogated.  System responses may also be transformed by the interface into a common form before being given to the users.  Thus, the network of different systems is made to look like a single \"virtual\" system to the user.  The interface also provides instruction and other search aids for the user.

Success was attributed, in part, to a simple command language, adequate online instruction, and a simplified natural-language, keyword/stem approach to searching.

The present article assesses the validity of this substitution in various environments.', '106': \"A set of experiments was conducted to determine the suitability of the Colon Classification as a foundation for the automated analysis, representation and retrieval of primary information from the full text of documents.  Primary information is that information embodied in the text of a document, as opposed to secondary information which is generally in such forms as:  an abstract, a table of contents, or an index. Full text databases were created in two subject areas and queries solicited from specialists in each area.  An automated full text indexing system, along with four automated passage retrieval systems, was created to test the various features of the Colon Classification.  Two Boolean-based systems and one simple word occurrence system were created in order to compare the retrieval results against types of systems which are in more common use.  The systems' retrieval performances were measured using recall and precision and the mean expected search length reduction factors. Overall, it was found that the Colon Classification-based systems did not perform significantly better than the other systems.\", '107': 'A study was carried out of the relationship between the vocabulary of user queries and the vocabulary of documents relevant to the queries, and the value of adding to the document description record in a retrieval system keywords from previous queries for which the document had proved useful. Two test databases incorporating user query keywords were implemented at the School of Library and Information Science, University of Western Ontario.  Clustering of the documents via title and user keywords, a statistical analysis of title-user keyword co-occurrences, and retrieval tests were used to examine the effect of the added keywords.  Results showed the impracticality of the procedure in an operational setting, but indicated the value of analyses with sample data in the development and maintenance of keyword dictionaries and thesauri.', '108': \"A technique of online instruction and assistance to bibliographic data base searchers called Individualized Instruction for Data Access (IIDA) is being developed by Drexel University.  IIDA assists searchers by providing feedback based on real-time analysis while searches are being performed. Extensive help facilities which draw on this analysis are available to users.  Much of the project's experimental work, as described elsewhere, is concerned with the process of searching and the behavior of searchers. This paper will largely address itself to the project's computer system, which is being developed by subcontract with the Franklin Institute's Science Information Services.\", '109': 'It is shown that the mapping of a particular area of science, in this case information science, can be done using authors as units of analysis and the cocitations of pairs of authors as the variable that indicates their \"distances\" from each other.  The analysis assumes that the more two authors are cited together, the closer the relationship between them.  The raw data are cocitation counts drawn online from Social Scisearch (Social Sciences Citation Index) over the period 1972-1979.  GThe resulting map shows (1) identifiable author groups (akin to \"schools\") of information science, (2) locations of these groups with respect to each other, (3) the degree of centrality and peripherality of authors within groups, (4) proximities of authors within group and across group boundaries (\"border authors\" who seem to connect various areas of research), and (5) positions of authors with respect to the map\\'s axes, which were arbitrarily set spanning the most divergent groups in order to aid interpretation.  Cocitation analysis of authors offers a new technique that might contribute to the understanding of intellectual structure in the sciences and possibly in other areas to the extent that those areas rely on serial publications.  The technique establishes authors, as well as documents, as an effective unit in analyzing subject specialties.', '110': 'The \"Office of the Future,\" \"Office Technology,\" \"Word Processing,\" \"Electronic Mail,\" \"Electronic Communications,\" \"Convergence,\" \"Information Management.\"  These are all terms included in the current list of buzz words used to describe current activities in the office technology area.  The high level of investment in factories and plants and the ever-increasing fight to improve productivity by automating the dull, routine jobs are usually quoted and compared with the extremely low investment in improving and automating the equally tedious routine jobs in the office environment; the investment in the factory is quoted as being ten times greater per employee than in the office.  This, however, is changing rapidly and investment on a large scale is already taking place in manhy areas as present-day inflation bites hard, forcing many companies and organizations to take a much closer look at their office operations.', '111': 'An automated document clustering procedure is described which does not require the use of an inter-document similarity matrix and which is independent of the order in which the documents are processed.  The procedure makes use of an initial set of clusters which is derived from certain of the terms in the indexing vocabulary used to characterise the documents in the file.  The retrieval effectiveness obtained using the clustered file is compared with that obtained from serial searching and from use of the single-linkage clustering method.', '112': 'A fast algorithm is described for comparing the lists of terms representing documents in automatic classification experiments.  The speed of the procedure arises from the fact that all of the non-zero-valued coefficicents for a given document are identified together, using an inverted file to the terms in the document collection.  The complexity and running time of the algorithm are compared with previously described procedures.'}\n"
